#Question 1
The policy behind this question consisted of going back on hill to gain momentum and going forward. However, one time was not enough, so the car goes back up again and tries it again and catches the flag!


The objective of all question were met except for question 3. In this question the cross entropy approach from cartpole question was taken, and I matched the steps in the algorithms, merging the codes, and used the modified rewards. While learning seemed to take place, and height went up every once in a while, I never reached the flag in question 3.
