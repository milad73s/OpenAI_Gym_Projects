Small reinforcement learning projects in OpenAI Gym

The objective of all question were met except for question 3. In this question the cross entropy approach from cartpole question was taken, and I matched the steps in the algorithms, merging the codes. While learning seemed to take place, and height went up every once in a while, I never reached the flag in question 3.
